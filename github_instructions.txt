# GitHub Push Instructions

After creating your repository on GitHub, connect your local repository by running these commands:

1. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/docway-360.git
   ```
   (Replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username)

2. Set the main branch (if needed):
   ```
   git branch -M main
   ```

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS, your remote URL would be:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/docway-360.git
```

For first-time GitHub users:
- You might need to authenticate through your browser or by entering credentials
- For better security, consider setting up SSH keys or a personal access token
- Follow the prompts provided by GitHub or Git
